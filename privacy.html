<h1>LT2 Tools - Privacy Policy</h1>
This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
Identifiable
Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is
information
that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to
identify an
individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use,
protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our Extension.

<h2>What personal information do we collect from the people that use LT2 Tools extension?</h2>
We DO NOT collect any Personally identifiable Information.

<h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
We only collect PII (your name) when you directly message us for customer support to allow us to better service you
in
responding to your customer service requests, and to follow up with you after correspondence (Facebook Chat).

<h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
<ul>
    <ol>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.</ol>
    <ol>We only provide exclusive features to improve Facebook using experience. We never ask for credit card
        numbers.
    </ol>
    <ol>We again do not store or collect any of user information.</ol>
    <ol>Your personal information is contained behind Browser's LocalStorage and is only accessible by yourself. In
        addition,
        when you log out of Facebook, LocalStorage is cleared so that no other person can access.</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Do we use 'cookies'?</h2>
We use cookies to make the whole extension functioning.
Instead of having users to log in or log out, we use cookies. Also, most features from LT2 Tools use
those
Facebook APIS that require cookies. However, no cookies is collected!

<h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.

<h2>Third-party links</h2>
We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.

<h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>
We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser
mechanism is in place.

<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and
conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
those
individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

    <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">Link</a>
</p>

<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first
    significant page after entering our website.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>

<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:</p>
<ul>
    <ol>On our Privacy Policy Page</ol>
</ul>

<p>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</p>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
    Children's
    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States'
    consumer
    protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must
    do
    to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts
    they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
    Understanding
    the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the
    various
    privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a
    data
    breach occur:</p>
<p>We will notify you via email within 1 business day</p>

<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally
    pursue
    enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
    not
    only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
    courts
    or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

    <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>

    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
        messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
        penalties for
        violations.</p>
    <p>However, we DO NOT collect your email address</p>
